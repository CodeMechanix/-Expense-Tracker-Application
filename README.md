# Expense Tracker Application

REST API for tracking expenses.
A RESTful API created using Spring Boot. We have used PostgreSQL as the relational databas.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repo from GitHub**
   ```sh
   git clone 
   cd folder
   ```
2. **Run the spring boot application**
   ```sh
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   this runs at port 8080 and hence all enpoints can be accessed starting from http://localhost:8080

## Key Technologies:
- Spring Boot Web for exposing RESTful webservices.
- Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for the  data access layer.
- Spring Boot Test
- JUnit 5 (JUnit Jupiter) as unit testing framework [Working]
- Mockito as mocking framework [Working]
